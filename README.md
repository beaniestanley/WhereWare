# Warehouse Product Locator

*Short name: WPL*

The WPL is an application for warehouse workers to locate a product in the most efficient
way and collect them in the fastest way.
The Application shows a list of the orders in each order, whereas every order contains the products and the quantity. 
With this application, the order collection will be optimized, and the time for order completion will be reduced, resulting in processing more orders per worker.
